# GREEN IT CALCULATOR
Our uses of digital technology are exploding; both on a personal and professional level. Our impacts are difficult to quantify because they are dematerialized. 

In order to shed light on the impacts linked to our over-consumption of digital technology, Decathlon has created a calculator that makes it possible to simply calculate its professional digital impact. 

The objective is of course to combine it with concrete actions (extending the lifespan of equipment, reducing online storage...) but also to compare it with our daily uses (work / air travel...).

The calculator is based on the databases provided by ADEME as well as data from GreenIT.fr.
